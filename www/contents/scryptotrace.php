<h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>
This product hides codes in any text or graphics. 
It is best described as an "Invisible barcode that can be read by a smartphone".

When those codes are read by the phone, a pre-defined message is displayed or (if Internet is available) a pre-defined web page can be displayed.

The phone does not rely on a permanent Internet connection to operate, but needs to be configured with the correct software and data. This can either be done sporadically and securely through the Internet, or when initially supplied.

Results can be securely fed back to a central database where they can be displayed using mapping software or spreadsheets and made available to your brand protection or marketing departments.
